## üìä What is ICE?

ICE is a prioritization framework that helps you evaluate ideas based on three key dimensions:

- **Impact**: How much value will this create if it works? (1-10)
- - **Confidence**: How sure are you about the Impact estimate? (1-100%)
  - - **Effort**: Time and complexity required to deliver? (1-10)
   
    - ### Formula
    - ```
      ICE Score = (Impact √ó Confidence) √∑ Effort
      ```

      Higher scores indicate better opportunities to prioritize first.
